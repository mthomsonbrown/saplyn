This is an app that tracks daily activity in a generic way.  You can post daily
stats for any activity, from running miles to marathoning Gilmore Girls, and it
will give you statistics that are relevant...generically.

With more people posting a specific activity, we will make specific modules that
capture that category in detail.  

## Motivation

This is mainly an experimental/exploratory app that I can use to exercise the full stack from server, to database, to web frontend, to mobile device.  I think it also serves a need in the Android world for a generic logging/tracking application.
